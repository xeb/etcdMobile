etcdMobile
==========

An iOS Mobile Client for [github.com/coreos/etcd](http://github.com/coreos/etcd).  The application is meant as an administrative tool for etcd nodes to support basic functionality such as: viewing & editing key values, changing TTLs, recursive searching for keys (TBD) and local notifications for watches (TBD).

Once the core functionality is complete, I will publish the client to the AppStore for others to use, for free of course.
